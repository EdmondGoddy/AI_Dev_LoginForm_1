## Development Prompt History

This project was created through an iterative AI-assisted development process. Below are the exact prompts used:

### Initial Prompt
```
Create a clean HTML5 login form with email and password fields. 
Use semantic HTML structure with proper doctype and meta tags. 
Include a 'Please Sign In' heading.
```

### Enhancement 1
```
Enhance the login form with a visually appealing background that has animated diagonal color blocks. 
Use CSS to create four colored diagonal sections (red, orange, blue, purple) that animate when hovered. 
Make sure the form stays centered.
```

### Enhancement 2
```
Now create a centered white form container that appears over the colored background. 
It should be 400px square, with proper padding and subtle opacity effects. 
Make it fade in when the background is hovered.
```

### Enhancement 3
```
Style the form inputs to match the modern aesthetic. 
They should be full-width with proper padding, subtle borders, 
and use the Raleway font from Google Fonts.
```

### Final Enhancement
```
Reorganize this login form code into a professional folder structure with separate files for HTML and CSS. 
Place all CSS in an external stylesheet and link it properly in the HTML head section.
```
